 And it makes some very cool errors. If you look at the image on the left, it's
<utterance number= 128 start=0:08:50 end= 0:08:54
 an earphone. It doesn't get anything like an earphone.
<utterance number= 129 start=0:08:54 end= 0:08:57
 But if you look at its fourth bet, it thinks it's an ant.
<utterance number= 130 start=0:08:57 end= 0:09:01
 And to begin with, you think that's crazy. But then if you look at it carefully, you
<utterance number= 131 start=0:09:01 end= 0:09:04
 can see it's a view from an ant from underneath. The eyes are looking down at
<utterance number= 132 start=0:09:04 end= 0:09:08
 you, and you can see the antennae behind it. It's not the kind of view of an ant
<utterance number= 133 start=0:09:08 end= 0:09:12
 you'd like to have if you were a green fly. If you look at the one on the right,
<utterance number= 134 start=0:09:12 end= 0:09:16
 it doesn't get the right answer. But all of its answers are cylindrical
<utterance number= 135 start=0:09:16 end= 0:09:20
 objects. Another question that I've been asked is,
