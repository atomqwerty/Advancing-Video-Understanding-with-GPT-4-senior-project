 And it makes some very cool errors. If you look at the image on the left, that's an earphone.
<utterance number= 81 start=0:08:52 end= 0:08:57
 It doesn't get anything like an earphone, but if you look at it as fourth bet, it thinks it's an ant.
<utterance number= 82 start=0:08:57 end= 0:09:04
 And to be with you, think that's crazy. But then if you look at it carefully, you can see it's a view from an ant from underneath. The eyes are looking down at you.
<utterance number= 83 start=0:09:04 end= 0:09:10
 And you can see the antennae behind it. It's not the kind of view of an ant you'd like to have if you were a green fly.
<utterance number= 84 start=0:09:10 end= 0:09:19
