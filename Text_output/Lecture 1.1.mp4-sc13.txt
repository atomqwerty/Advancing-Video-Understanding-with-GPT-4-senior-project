 neural network, when used as the acoustic model in a speech system, reduced the error rate from 27.4% to 18.5%,Hi,
<utterance number= 170 start=0:12:15 end= 0:12:23
 and relatively, you could view it as reducing the amount of training data you needed from 2,000 hours down to 309 hours to get comparable performance.
<utterance number= 171 start=0:12:23 end= 0:12:41
 IBM, which has the best system for one of the standard speech recognition tasks for large vocabulary speech recognition, showed that even its very highly tuned system that was getting 18.8% can be beaten by one of these deep neural networks.

 And Google, fairly recently, trained a deep neural network to do the same.

 So for example, in this case it was a news ad that was a little bit less than the average speech recognition time of the day, and even with your big neural network on a large amount of speech, 5,800 hours, that was still much less than they trained their Gaussian mixturing model on.
<utterance number= 178 start=0:12:52 end= 0:12:58
 But even with much less data, it did a lot better than the technology they had before.
<utterance number= 179 start=0:12:58 end= 0:13:04
 So it reduced the error rate from 16% to 12.3%, and the error rate is still falling.
<utterance number= 180 start=0:13:04 end= 0:13:13.900000
 And in the latest Android, if you do voice search, it's using one of these deep neural networks in order to do very good speech recognition.
