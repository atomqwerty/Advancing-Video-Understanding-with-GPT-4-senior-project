 So if you look at recent results from several different leading speech groups, Microsoft showed that this kind of deep
<utterance number= 169 start=0:12:06 end= 0:12:15
 neural network, when used as the acoustic model in a speech system, reduced the error rate from 27.4% to 18.5%.
<utterance number= 170 start=0:12:15 end= 0:12:23
 And relatively, you could view it as reducing the amount of training data you needed from 2,000 hours down to 309 hours to get comparable performance.
<utterance number= 171 start=0:12:23 end= 0:12:41
 IBM, which has the best system for one of the standard speech recognition tasks for large vocabulary speech recognition, showed that even its very highly tuned system that was getting 18.8% can be beaten by one of these deep neural networks.
<utterance number= 172 start=0:12:41 end= 0:12:43
 And Google fairly recently trained a deep neural network to do the same.
<utterance number= 173 start=0:12:43 end= 0:12:49
 Google fairly recently trained a deep neural network on a large amount of speech, 5,800 hours.
<utterance number= 174 start=0:12:49 end= 0:12:53
 That was still much less than they trained their Gaussian mixture model on.
<utterance number= 175 start=0:12:53 end= 0:12:59
 But even with much less data, it did a lot better than the technology they had before.
<utterance number= 176 start=0:12:59 end= 0:13:04
 So it reduced the error rate from 16% to 12.3%, and the error rate is still falling.
<utterance number= 177 start=0:13:04 end= 0:13:12
 And in the latest Android, if you do voice search, it's using one of these deep neural networks in order to do very good speech recognition.
<utterance number= 178 start=0:13:12 end= 0:13:13
 So it's a very good way to do that.
<utterance number= 179 start=0:13:13 end= 0:13:14
 Thank you.
