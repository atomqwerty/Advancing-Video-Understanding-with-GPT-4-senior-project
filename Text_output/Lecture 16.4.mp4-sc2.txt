Why we cannot predict the long-term future

Consider driving at night. The number of photons you receive fram
the tail-lights of the car in front falls off as I Id?
Now suppose there is fog.

= For small distances its stil 1/d?

â€” But for big distances its exp(-d) because fog absorbs a certain
fraction of the photons per unit distance

So the car in front becomes gompletely invisible at a distance at
which our short-range 1 / d~ model predicts it will be very visible.

 I'm going to try and explain why we can't predict the long-term future by using an
<utterance number= 5 start=0:00:19 end= 0:00:23
 analogy. Imagine you're driving a car at night, and
<utterance number= 6 start=0:00:23 end= 0:00:27
 you're looking at the tail lights of the car in front.
<utterance number= 7 start=0:00:27 end= 0:00:32
 The number of photons that you receive from the tail lights of the car in front falls
<utterance number= 8 start=0:00:32 end= 0:00:37
 off as 1 over d squared, where d is the distance to the car in front.
<utterance number= 9 start=0:00:37 end= 0:00:42
 That's assuming that the air is clear. And now suppose there's fog.
<utterance number= 10 start=0:00:42 end= 0:00:47
 Over short ranges, the number of photons you get from the tail lights in front of
<utterance number= 11 start=0:00:47 end= 0:00:52
 you still falls off as 1 over d squared. Because over a short range, the fog hardly
<utterance number= 12 start=0:00:52 end= 0:00:57
 absorbs any light. But for large distances, it falls off as e to the minus d.
<utterance number= 13 start=0:00:57 end= 0:01:00
 And that's because fog has an exponential effect.
<utterance number= 14 start=0:01:00 end= 0:01:05
 Fog absorbs a certain fraction of the photons per unit distance.
<utterance number= 15 start=0:01:05 end= 0:01:10
 So for small distances, fog looks very transparent. But for large distances, it
<utterance number= 16 start=0:01:10 end= 0:01:14
 looks very opaque. So the car in front of us becomes
<utterance number= 17 start=0:01:14 end= 0:01:19
 completely invisible at a distance which our short range model, the 1 over d
<utterance number= 18 start=0:01:19 end= 0:01:22
 squared model, predicts it will be very visible.
<utterance number= 19 start=0:01:22 end= 0:01:26
 That causes people to drive into the back of cars in fog.
<utterance number= 20 start=0:01:26 end= 0:01:27
 It kills people.
<utterance number= 21 start=0:01:27 end= 0:01:31
 The development of technology is also typically exponential.
