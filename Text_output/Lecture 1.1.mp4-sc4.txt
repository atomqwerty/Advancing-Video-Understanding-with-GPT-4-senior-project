Some examples of tasks best solved by learning
Recognizing pattems:
-Objects in real scenes
- Facial identities or facial expressions
- Spoken words
Recognizing anomalies:
-
Unusual sequences of credit card transactions
Unusual patterns of sensor readings in a nuclear power plant
Prediction:
-
-
-
Future stock prices or currency exchange rates
Which movies will a person like?
<utterances>
 <utterance number= 21 start=0:02:30 end= 0:02:40
 So for example objects in real scenes or the identities or expressions of people's faces or spoken words.
<utterance number= 22 start=0:02:40 end= 0:02:44
 There's also recognizing anomalies.
<utterance number= 23 start=0:02:44 end= 0:02:49
 So an unusual sequence of credit card transactions would be anonymly.
<utterance number= 24 start=0:02:49 end= 0:02:55
 Another example of anonymly would be an unusual pattern of sensor readings in a nuclear power plant.
<utterance number= 25 start=0:02:55 end= 0:03:04
 And you wouldn't really want to have to deal with those by doing supervised learning where you look at the ones that blow up and see what, what cause them to blow up.
<utterance number= 26 start=0:03:04 end= 0:03:09
 You'd really like to recognize that something funny is happening without having any supervision signal.
<utterance number= 27 start=0:03:09 end= 0:03:12
 It's just not behaving in its normal way.
<utterance number= 28 start=0:03:12 end= 0:03:22
 And then this prediction, so typically predicting future stock prices or currency exchange rates, or predicting which movies are person were like,
<utterance number= 29 start=0:03:22 end= 0:03:28
 from knowing which other movies they like and which movies a lot of other people like.
