 In this final video, I was tempted to make some predictions about the future of
timestamp: 0:00:05 - 0:00:10
 research on neural networks. Instead, I'm going to explain to you why it
timestamp: 0:00:10 - 0:00:14
 would be extremely foolish to try and make any long-term predictions.

Why we cannot predict the long-term future

Consider driving at night. The number of photons you receive fram
the tail-lights of the car in front falls off as I Id?
Now suppose there is fog.

= For small distances its stil 1/d?

— But for big distances its exp(-d) because fog absorbs a certain
fraction of the photons per unit distance

So the car in front becomes gompletely invisible at a distance at
which our short-range 1 / d~ model predicts it will be very visible.

 I'm going to try and explain why we can't predict the long-term future by using an
timestamp: 0:00:19 - 0:00:23
 analogy. Imagine you're driving a car at night, and
timestamp: 0:00:23 - 0:00:27
 you're looking at the tail lights of the car in front.
timestamp: 0:00:27 - 0:00:32
 The number of photons that you receive from the tail lights of the car in front falls
timestamp: 0:00:32 - 0:00:37
 off as 1 over d squared, where d is the distance to the car in front.
timestamp: 0:00:37 - 0:00:42
 That's assuming that the air is clear. And now suppose there's fog.
timestamp: 0:00:42 - 0:00:47
 Over short ranges, the number of photons you get from the tail lights in front of
timestamp: 0:00:47 - 0:00:52
 you still falls off as 1 over d squared. Because over a short range, the fog hardly
timestamp: 0:00:52 - 0:00:57
 absorbs any light. But for large distances, it falls off as e to the minus d.
timestamp: 0:00:57 - 0:01:00
 And that's because fog has an exponential effect.
timestamp: 0:01:00 - 0:01:05
 Fog absorbs a certain fraction of the photons per unit distance.
timestamp: 0:01:05 - 0:01:10
 So for small distances, fog looks very transparent. But for large distances, it
timestamp: 0:01:10 - 0:01:14
 looks very opaque. So the car in front of us becomes
timestamp: 0:01:14 - 0:01:19
 completely invisible at a distance which our short range model, the 1 over d
timestamp: 0:01:19 - 0:01:22
 squared model, predicts it will be very visible.
timestamp: 0:01:22 - 0:01:26
 That causes people to drive into the back of cars in fog.
timestamp: 0:01:26 - 0:01:27
 It kills people.
timestamp: 0:01:27 - 0:01:31
 The development of technology is also typically exponential.

ASR: timestamp: 0:01:31 - 0:01:36
 So over the short term, things appear to change fairly slowly and it's easy to
timestamp: 0:01:36 - 0:01:40
 predict progress. All of us, for example, can probably make quite good guesses
timestamp: 0:01:40 - 0:01:45
 about what will be in the iPhone 6. But in the longer run, our perception of the
timestamp: 0:01:45 - 0:01:48
 future hits a wall, just like with fog.
timestamp: 0:01:48 - 0:01:53
 So the long term future of machine learning and neural nets is really a total mystery.
timestamp: 0:01:53 - 0:01:56
 We've no idea what's going to happen in 30 years time.
timestamp: 0:01:56 - 0:01:59
 There's just no way to predict it from what we know now.
timestamp: 0:01:59 - 0:02:02
 Because we're going to get exponential progress.
timestamp: 0:02:02 - 0:02:07
 In the short run, however, in a period of, say, 3 to 10 years, we can predict it
timestamp: 0:02:07 - 0:02:10
 fairly well. And it seems obvious to me that over the
timestamp: 0:02:10 - 0:02:15
 next 5 years or so, big deep neural networks are going to do amazing things.
timestamp: 0:02:15 - 0:02:20
 I'd like to congratulate all of you who stuck it out long enough to get this far.
timestamp: 0:02:20 - 0:02:25
 I hope you've enjoyed the course and good luck with the final test.
