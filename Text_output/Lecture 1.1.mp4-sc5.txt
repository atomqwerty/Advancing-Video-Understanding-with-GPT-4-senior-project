A standard example of machine learning
A lot of genetics is done on fruit flies.
They are convenient because they breed fast.
We already know a lot about them.
The MNIST database of hand-written digits is the the machine learning
equivalent of fruit flies.
-
-
They are publicly available and we can learn them quite fast in a
moderate-sized neural net.
We know a huge amount about how well various machine learning
methods do on MNIST.
We will use MNIST as our standard task.
<utterances>
 <utterance number= 30 start=0:03:28 end= 0:03:37
 So in this course, I'm going to use a standard example for explaining a lot of the machine learning algorithms.
<utterance number= 31 start=0:03:37 end= 0:03:43
 This is done in a lot of science. In genetics for example, a lot of genetics is done on fruit flies.
<utterance number= 32 start=0:03:44 end= 0:03:52
 And the reason is their convenient. They breed fast and a lot is already known about the genesis of fruit flies.
<utterance number= 33 start=0:03:52 end= 0:04:00
 The emnis database of handwritten digits is the machine learning equivalent of fruit flies.
<utterance number= 34 start=0:04:00 end= 0:04:02
 It's publicly available.
<utterance number= 35 start=0:04:02 end= 0:04:09
 We can get machine learning algorithms to learn how to recognize these handwritten digits quite quickly.
<utterance number= 36 start=0:04:09 end= 0:04:12
 So it's easy to try lots of variations.
<utterance number= 37 start=0:04:12 end= 0:04:17
 And we know huge amounts about how well different machine learning methods do on emnist.
<utterance number= 38 start=0:04:17 end= 0:04:25
 And in particular, the different machine learning methods were implemented by people who believed in them, so we can rely on those results.
<utterance number= 39 start=0:04:25 end= 0:04:30
 So for all those reasons, we're going to use emnist as our standard task.
