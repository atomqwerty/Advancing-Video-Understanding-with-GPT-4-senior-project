A standard example of machine learning
A lot of genetics is done on fruit flies.
They are convenient because they breed fast.
We already know a lot about them.
The MNIST database of hand-written digits is the the machine learning
equivalent of fruit flies.
-
-
They are publicly available and we can learn them quite fast in a
moderate-sized neural net.
We know a huge amount about how well various machine learning
methods do on MNIST.
We will use MNIST as our standard task.
<utterances>
 <utterance number= 50 start=0:03:33 end= 0:03:38
 the machine learning algorithms. This is done in a lot of science.
<utterance number= 51 start=0:03:38 end= 0:03:43
 In genetics, for example, a lot of genetics is done on fruit flies.
<utterance number= 52 start=0:03:43 end= 0:03:47
 And the reason is they're convenient. They breed fast.
<utterance number= 53 start=0:03:47 end= 0:03:51
 And a lot is already known about the genetics of fruit flies.
<utterance number= 54 start=0:03:51 end= 0:03:57
 The MNIST database of handwritten digits is the machine learning algorithm that
<utterance number= 55 start=0:03:57 end= 0:04:00
 is the machine learning equivalent of fruit flies.
<utterance number= 56 start=0:04:00 end= 0:04:05
 It's publicly available. We can get machine learning algorithms to
<utterance number= 57 start=0:04:05 end= 0:04:09
 learn how to recognize these handwritten digits quite quickly.
<utterance number= 58 start=0:04:09 end= 0:04:14
 So, it's easy to try lots of variations. And we know huge amounts about how well
<utterance number= 59 start=0:04:14 end= 0:04:17
 different machine learning methods do on MNIST.
<utterance number= 60 start=0:04:17 end= 0:04:21
 And in particular, the different machine learning methods were implemented by
<utterance number= 61 start=0:04:21 end= 0:04:25
 people who believed in them. So, we can rely on those results.
<utterance number= 62 start=0:04:25 end= 0:04:29
 So, for all those reasons, we're going to use MNIST as our standard task.
<utterance number= 63 start=0:04:29 end= 0:04:34
 Here's an example of some of the digits in MNIST.
