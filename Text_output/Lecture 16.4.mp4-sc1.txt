 In this final video, I was tempted to make some predictions about the future of
<utterance number= 2 start=0:00:05 end= 0:00:10
 research on neural networks. Instead, I'm going to explain to you why it
<utterance number= 3 start=0:00:10 end= 0:00:14
 would be extremely foolish to try and make any long-term predictions.
