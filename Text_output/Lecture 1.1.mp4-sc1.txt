 Hello. Welcome to the Coursera course on neural
<utterance number= 2 start=0:00:04 end= 0:00:09
 networks for machine learning. Before we get into the details of neural
<utterance number= 3 start=0:00:09 end= 0:00:14
 network learning algorithms, I want to talk a little bit about machine learning,
<utterance number= 4 start=0:00:14 end= 0:00:19
 why we need machine learning, the kinds of things we use it for, and show you some
<utterance number= 5 start=0:00:19 end= 0:00:24
 examples of what it can do. So, the reason we need machine learning is
