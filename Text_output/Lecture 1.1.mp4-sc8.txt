 These images from the test set that is never seen before.
<utterance number= 65 start=0:07:03 end= 0:07:16
 And below the examples, I'm showing you what the neural net thought the right answer was, where the length of the horizontal bias, how confident it was, and the correct answer is in red.
<utterance number= 66 start=0:07:16 end= 0:07:20
 So if you look in the middle, it correctly identified that as a snow plow.
<utterance number= 67 start=0:07:20 end= 0:07:24
 But you can see that it's other choices, we're also fairly sensible.
<utterance number= 68 start=0:07:24 end= 0:07:31
 It does look a little bit like a drilling platform. And if you look at its third choice, a lifeboat, it actually looks very like a lifeboat.
<utterance number= 69 start=0:07:31 end= 0:07:37
 You can see the flag on the front of the boat and the bridge of the boat and the flag at the back and the high surf in the background.
<utterance number= 70 start=0:07:37 end= 0:07:42
 So it's, it's errors tell you a lot about how it's doing it and they're very plausible errors.
<utterance number= 71 start=0:07:42 end= 0:07:53
 If you look on the left, it gets it wrong, possibly because the beak of the bird is missing and because the feathers of the bird look very like the wet fur of an auto.
<utterance number= 72 start=0:07:53 end= 0:08:00
 But it gets in in this top five and it does better than me. I wouldn't know if that was a quail or a roughed grass or a partridge.
<utterance number= 73 start=0:08:00 end= 0:08:03
 If you look on the right, it gets a completely wrong.
<utterance number= 74 start=0:08:04 end= 0:08:13
 It, um, agility, you can see why it says that. You can possibly see why it says orangutan because of the sort of jungle looking background is something orange in the middle.
<utterance number= 75 start=0:08:13 end= 0:08:16
 But it fails to get the right answer.
<utterance number= 76 start=0:08:16 end= 0:08:25
 It can, however, deal with a wide range of different objects. If you look on the left, I would have said micro-overs, my first answer.
