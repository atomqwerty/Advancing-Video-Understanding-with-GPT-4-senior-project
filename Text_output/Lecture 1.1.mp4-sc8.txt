Some examples of tasks best solved by learning

+ Recognizing pattems:
— Objects in real scenes
— Facial identities or facial expressions
— Spoken words
+ Recognizing anomalies:
— Unusual sequences of credit card transactions
— Unusual patterns of sensor readings in a nuclear power plant
+ Prediction:
— Future stock prices or currency exchange rates
— Which movies will a person like?

 These are images from the test set that it's never seen before.
<utterance number= 100 start=0:07:03 end= 0:07:08
 And below the examples, I'm showing you what the neural net thought the right
<utterance number= 101 start=0:07:08 end= 0:07:13
 answer was, where the length of the horizontal bar is how confident it was,
<utterance number= 102 start=0:07:13 end= 0:07:18
 and the correct answer is in red. So, if you look in the middle, it correctly
<utterance number= 103 start=0:07:18 end= 0:07:21
 identified that as a snowplow. But you can see that it's unbiased.
<utterance number= 104 start=0:07:21 end= 0:07:24
 But you can see that its other choices were also fairly sensible.
<utterance number= 105 start=0:07:24 end= 0:07:27
 It does look a little bit like a drilling platform.
<utterance number= 106 start=0:07:27 end= 0:07:30
 And if you look at its third choice, a lifeboat, it actually looks very like a
<utterance number= 107 start=0:07:30 end= 0:07:32
 lifeboat. You can see the flag on the front of the
<utterance number= 108 start=0:07:32 end= 0:07:36
 boat and the bridge of the boat and the flag at the back and the high surf in the
<utterance number= 109 start=0:07:36 end= 0:07:39
 background. So it's, its errors tell you a lot about
<utterance number= 110 start=0:07:39 end= 0:07:42
 how it's doing it and they're very plausible errors.
<utterance number= 111 start=0:07:42 end= 0:07:47
 If you look on the left, it gets it wrong, possibly because the beak of the bird is
<utterance number= 112 start=0:07:47 end= 0:07:50
 missing and because the feathers of the bird look very like the flag of the bird.
<utterance number= 113 start=0:07:50 end= 0:07:55
 Look very like the wet fur of an otter. But it gets it in its top five and it
<utterance number= 114 start=0:07:55 end= 0:07:58
 does better than me. I wouldn't know if that was a quail or
<utterance number= 115 start=0:07:58 end= 0:08:02
 a roughed grouse or a partridge. If you look on the right, it gets it
<utterance number= 116 start=0:08:02 end= 0:08:06
 completely wrong. It a guillotine, you can see why it says
<utterance number= 117 start=0:08:06 end= 0:08:09
 that. You can possibly see why it says orangutan
<utterance number= 118 start=0:08:09 end= 0:08:12
 because of the sort of jungle looking background and something orange in the
<utterance number= 119 start=0:08:12 end= 0:08:15
 middle. But it fails to get the right answer.
<utterance number= 120 start=0:08:15 end= 0:08:19
 It can, however, deal with a wide range of different objects.
<utterance number= 121 start=0:08:20 end= 0:08:25
 If you look on the left, I would have said microwave was my first answer.
