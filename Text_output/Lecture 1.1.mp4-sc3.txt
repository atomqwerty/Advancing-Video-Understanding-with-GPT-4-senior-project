The Machine Learning Approach
Instead of writing a program by hand for each specific task, we collect
lots of examples that specify the correct output for a given input.
A machine learning algorithm then takes these examples and produces
a program that does the job.
- The program produced by the learning algorithm may look very
different from a typical hand-written program. It may contain millions
of numbers.

-
If we do it right, the program works for new cases as well as the ones
we trained it on.
If the data changes the program can change too by training on the
new data.
Massive amounts of computation are now cheaper than paying
someone to write a task-specific program.

 The machine learning approach is to say instead of writing each program by hand for each specific task, for a particular task we're collecting a lot of examples that specify the correct output for a given input.
<utterance number= 13 start=0:01:33 end= 0:01:39
 A machine learning algorithm then takes these examples and produces a program that does the job.
<utterance number= 14 start=0:01:39 end= 0:01:46
 The program produced by the learning algorithm may look very different from a typical handwritten program.
<utterance number= 15 start=0:01:46 end= 0:01:52
 For example it might contain millions of numbers about how you wait different kinds of evidence.
<utterance number= 16 start=0:01:52 end= 0:01:58
 If we do it right the program should work for new cases as well as the ones it's trained on.
<utterance number= 17 start=0:01:58 end= 0:02:07
 And if the data changes, we should be able to change the program relatively easily by retrain it on the new data.
<utterance number= 18 start=0:02:07 end= 0:02:13
 And now, mass romance or computation, a cheaper than paying someone to write a program for a specific task.
<utterance number= 19 start=0:02:13 end= 0:02:22
 So we can afford big complicated machine learning programs to produce the task specific systems for us.
<utterance number= 20 start=0:02:22 end= 0:02:30
 Some examples of the things that are best done by using a learning algorithm are recognizing patterns.
