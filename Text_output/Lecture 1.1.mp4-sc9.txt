A standard example of machine learning
A lot of genetics is done on fruit flies.
They are convenient because they breed fast.
We already know a lot about them.
The MNIST database of hand-written digits is the the machine learning
equivalent of fruit flies.
-
-
They are publicly available and we can learn them quite fast in a
moderate-sized neural net.
We know a huge amount about how well various machine learning
methods do on MNIST.
We will use MNIST as our standard task.

 If you look on the left, I would have said microwave was my first answer.
<utterance number= 122 start=0:08:25 end= 0:08:29
 The labels aren't very systematic, so actually the correct answer there is
<utterance number= 123 start=0:08:29 end= 0:08:33
 electric range and does get it in its top five.
<utterance number= 124 start=0:08:33 end= 0:08:36
 In the middle, it's getting a turnstile, which is a distributed object.
<utterance number= 125 start=0:08:36 end= 0:08:40
 It does, it can do more than just recognize compact things.
<utterance number= 126 start=0:08:40 end= 0:08:45
 And it can also deal with pictures as well as real scenes, like the bulletproof vest.
