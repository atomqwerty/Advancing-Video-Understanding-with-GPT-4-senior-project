 The labels are very systematic. So actually the correct answer there is electric range and does get it in this top five.
<utterance number= 78 start=0:08:33 end= 0:08:40
 In the middle it's getting a turn star which is distributed object. It can do more than just recognise compact things.
<utterance number= 79 start=0:08:40 end= 0:08:45
 And it can also deal with pictures as well as real scenes like the bulletproof vest.
