 that there's some problems where it's very hard to write the programs.
<utterance number= 7 start=0:00:29 end= 0:00:33
 Recognizing a three-dimensional object, for example, when it's from a novel
<utterance number= 8 start=0:00:33 end= 0:00:38
 viewpoint in new lighting conditions in a cluttered scene is very hard to do.
<utterance number= 9 start=0:00:38 end= 0:00:42
 We don't know what program to write because we don't know how it's done in
<utterance number= 10 start=0:00:42 end= 0:00:45
 our brain. And even if we did know what program to
<utterance number= 11 start=0:00:45 end= 0:00:50
 write, it might be that it was a horrendously complicated program.
<utterance number= 12 start=0:00:50 end= 0:00:55
 Another example is detecting a fraudulent credit card transaction, where there may
<utterance number= 13 start=0:00:55 end= 0:00:59
 not be any nice simple rules that will tell you it's fraudulent.
<utterance number= 14 start=0:00:59 end= 0:01:05
 You really need to combine a very large number of not very reliable rules.
<utterance number= 15 start=0:01:05 end= 0:01:10
 And also, those rules change over time because people change the tricks they use
<utterance number= 16 start=0:01:10 end= 0:01:13
 for fraud. So, we need a complicated program that
<utterance number= 17 start=0:01:13 end= 0:01:17
 combines unreliable rules and that we can change easily.
<utterance number= 18 start=0:01:17 end= 0:01:23
 The machine learning approach is to say instead of writing each program by hand
