What is Machine Learning?
It is very hard to write programs that solve problems like recognizing a
three-dimensional object from a novel viewpoint in new lighting
conditions in a cluttered scene.
-
We don't know what program to write because we don't know
how its done in our brain.
-Even if we had a good idea about how to do it, the program might
be horrendously complicated.
It is hard to write a program to compute the probability that a credit
card transaction is fraudulent.
-
There may not be any rules that are both simple and reliable. We
need to combine a very large number of weak rules.
Fraud is a moving target. The program needs to keep changing.
<utterances>
 <utterance number= 4 start=0:00:22 end= 0:00:29
 The reason we need machine learning is that the some problems where it's very hard to write the programs.
<utterance number= 5 start=0:00:29 end= 0:00:38
 Recognizing a three-dimensional object, for example, when it's from a novel viewpoint in new lighting conditions in a cluttered scene, is very hard to do.
<utterance number= 6 start=0:00:38 end= 0:00:43
 We don't know what programs are right because we don't know how it's done in our brain.
<utterance number= 7 start=0:00:43 end= 0:00:50
 And even if we did know what programs are right, it might be that it was a horrendously complicated program.
<utterance number= 8 start=0:00:51 end= 0:01:00
 Another example is detecting a fraudulent credit card transaction, where there may not be any nice simple rules that will tell you it's fraudulent.
<utterance number= 9 start=0:01:00 end= 0:01:05
 You really need to combine a very large number of not very reliable rules.
<utterance number= 10 start=0:01:05 end= 0:01:11
 And also those rules change over time because people change the tricks they use for fraud.
<utterance number= 11 start=0:01:11 end= 0:01:18
 So we need a complicated program that combines unreliable rules and that we can change easily.
<utterance number= 12 start=0:01:19 end= 0:01:33
 The machine learning approach is to say instead of writing each program by hand for each specific task, for a particular task we're collecting a lot of examples that specify the correct output for a given input.
