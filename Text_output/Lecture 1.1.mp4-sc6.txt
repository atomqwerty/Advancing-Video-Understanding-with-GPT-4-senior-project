What is Machine Learning?

Its very hard to write programs that solve problems like recognizing a
three-dimensional abject from a novel viewpoint in new lighting
conditions in a cluttered scene.
— We don’ t know what program to write because we don’ t know
how its done in our brain
— Even if we had a good idea about how to do it, the program might
be horrendously complicated.

Its hard to write a program te compute the probability that a credit
card transaction is fraudulent.

— There may not be any rules that are both simple and reliable. We
need to combine a very large number of weak rules.

— Fraud is a moving target. The program needs to keep changing.

 These are ones that were correctly recognized by neural net the first time it
<utterance number= 65 start=0:04:39 end= 0:04:43
 saw them. But they're ones where the neural net
<utterance number= 66 start=0:04:43 end= 0:04:46
 wasn't very confident. And you can see why.
<utterance number= 67 start=0:04:46 end= 0:04:51
 I've arranged these digits in standard scanline order.
<utterance number= 68 start=0:04:51 end= 0:04:54
 So, zeros, then ones, then twos, and so on.
<utterance number= 69 start=0:04:54 end= 0:04:59
 If you look at a bunch of twos, like the ones in the green rectangle, you can see
<utterance number= 70 start=0:04:59 end= 0:05:04
 that if you knew they were a handwritten digit, you'd probably guess they were
<utterance number= 71 start=0:05:04 end= 0:05:07
 twos. But it's very hard to say what it is that
<utterance number= 72 start=0:05:07 end= 0:05:10
 makes them twos. There's nothing simple that they all have
<utterance number= 73 start=0:05:10 end= 0:05:13
 in common. In particular, if you try and overlay one
<utterance number= 74 start=0:05:13 end= 0:05:18
 on another, you'll see it doesn't fit. And even if you skew it a bit, it's very
<utterance number= 75 start=0:05:18 end= 0:05:23
 hard to make them overlay on each other. So, a template isn't going to do the job.
<utterance number= 76 start=0:05:23 end= 0:05:24
 And in particular, if you try and overlay one on another, you'll see it doesn't fit.
<utterance number= 77 start=0:05:24 end= 0:05:28
 And in particular, a template is going to be very hard to find that'll fit those
<utterance number= 78 start=0:05:28 end= 0:05:33
 twos in the green box and won't also fit the things in the red boxes.
<utterance number= 79 start=0:05:33 end= 0:05:38
 So, that's one thing that makes recognizing handwritten digits a good task for machine
<utterance number= 80 start=0:05:38 end= 0:05:41
 learning. Now, I don't want you to think that's the
