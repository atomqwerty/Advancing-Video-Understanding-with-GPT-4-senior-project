Beyond MNIST: The ImageNet task
1000 different object classes in 1.3 million high-resolution training images
from the web.
- Best system in 2010 competition got 47% error for its first choice and
25% error for its top 5 choices.
Jitendra Malik (an eminent neural net sceptic) said that this competition is
a good test of whether deep neural networks work well for object
recognition.

A very deep neural net (Krizhevsky et. al. 2012) gets less that 40%
error for its first choice and less than 20% for its top 5 choices
(see lecture 5).

 <utterance number= 54 start=0:05:43 end= 0:05:47
 It's a relatively simple thing for a machine learning system to do now.
<utterance number= 55 start=0:05:47 end= 0:05:53
 And to motivate the rest of the course, I want to show you some examples of much more difficult things.
<utterance number= 56 start=0:05:53 end= 0:05:59
 So we now have neural nets with approaching 100 million parameters in them.
<utterance number= 57 start=0:05:59 end= 0:06:09
 And that can recognize a thousand different object classes in 1.3 million high resolution training images got from the web.
<utterance number= 58 start=0:06:09 end= 0:06:17
 So there was a competition in 2010 and the best system got 47% error rate if you look at its first choice.
<utterance number= 59 start=0:06:17 end= 0:06:25
 And 25% error rate, if you say it got it right if it was in its top five choices, which isn't bad for a thousand different objects.
<utterance number= 60 start=0:06:25 end= 0:06:39
 Jitendromalic, who's an eminent neural net skeptic and a leading computer vision researcher, has said that this competition is a good test of whether deep neural networks can work well for object recognition.
<utterance number= 61 start=0:06:39 end= 0:06:47
 And a very deep neural network can now do considerably better than the thing that won the competition.
<utterance number= 62 start=0:06:47 end= 0:06:53
 It can get less than 40% error for its first choice and less than 20% error for its top five choices.
<utterance number= 63 start=0:06:53 end= 0:06:59
 I'll describe that in much more detail in lecture five. Here's some examples of the kinds of images you have to recognize.
