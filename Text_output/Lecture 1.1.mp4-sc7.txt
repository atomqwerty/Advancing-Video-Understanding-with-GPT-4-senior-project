The Machine Learning Approach
Instead of writing a program by hand for each specific task, we collect
lots of examples that specify the correct output for a given input.
A machine learning algorithm then takes these examples and produces
a program that does the job.
- The program produced by the learning algorithm may look very
different from a typical hand-written program. It may contain millions
of numbers.

-
If we do it right, the program works for new cases as well as the ones
we trained it on.
If the data changes the program can change too by training on the
new data.
Massive amounts of computation are now cheaper than paying
someone to write a task-specific program.

 <utterance number= 81 start=0:05:41 end= 0:05:45
 only thing we can do. It's a relatively simple thing for a machine
<utterance number= 82 start=0:05:45 end= 0:05:49
 learning system to do now. And to motivate the rest of the course, I
<utterance number= 83 start=0:05:49 end= 0:05:53
 want to show you some examples of much more difficult things.
<utterance number= 84 start=0:05:53 end= 0:05:58
 So, we now have neural nets with approaching 100 million parameters in
<utterance number= 85 start=0:05:58 end= 0:06:05
 them that can recognize a thousand different object classes in 1.3 million
<utterance number= 86 start=0:06:05 end= 0:06:09
 high resolution training images got from the web.
<utterance number= 87 start=0:06:09 end= 0:06:15
 So, there was a competition in 2010 and the best system got 47% error rate if you
<utterance number= 88 start=0:06:15 end= 0:06:20
 look at its first choice and 25% error rate if you say it got it right if it was
<utterance number= 89 start=0:06:20 end= 0:06:22
 in its top five choices, which isn't bad for a thousand percent error rate.
<utterance number= 90 start=0:06:22 end= 0:06:25
 Which isn't bad for a thousand different objects.
<utterance number= 91 start=0:06:25 end= 0:06:31
 Jitendra Malik, who's an eminent neural net skeptic and a leading computer vision
<utterance number= 92 start=0:06:31 end= 0:06:36
 researcher has said that this competition is a good test of whether deep neural
<utterance number= 93 start=0:06:36 end= 0:06:43
 networks can work well for object recognition. And a very deep neural network can
<utterance number= 94 start=0:06:43 end= 0:06:47
 now do considerably better than the thing that won the competition.
<utterance number= 95 start=0:06:47 end= 0:06:51
 It can get less than 40% error for its first choice and less than 20% error for
<utterance number= 96 start=0:06:51 end= 0:06:52
 its top five choices.
<utterance number= 97 start=0:06:52 end= 0:06:55
 I'll describe that in much more detail in lecture five.
<utterance number= 98 start=0:06:55 end= 0:06:59
 Here's some examples of the kinds of images you have to recognize.
