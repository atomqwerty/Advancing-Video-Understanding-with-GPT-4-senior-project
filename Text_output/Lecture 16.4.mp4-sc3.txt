 So over the short term, things appear to change fairly slowly and it's easy to
<utterance number= 23 start=0:01:36 end= 0:01:40
 predict progress. All of us, for example, can probably make quite good guesses
<utterance number= 24 start=0:01:40 end= 0:01:45
 about what will be in the iPhone 6. But in the longer run, our perception of the
<utterance number= 25 start=0:01:45 end= 0:01:48
 future hits a wall, just like with fog.
<utterance number= 26 start=0:01:48 end= 0:01:53
 So the long term future of machine learning and neural nets is really a total mystery.
<utterance number= 27 start=0:01:53 end= 0:01:56
 We've no idea what's going to happen in 30 years time.
<utterance number= 28 start=0:01:56 end= 0:01:59
 There's just no way to predict it from what we know now.
<utterance number= 29 start=0:01:59 end= 0:02:02
 Because we're going to get exponential progress.
<utterance number= 30 start=0:02:02 end= 0:02:07
 In the short run, however, in a period of, say, 3 to 10 years, we can predict it
<utterance number= 31 start=0:02:07 end= 0:02:10
 fairly well. And it seems obvious to me that over the
<utterance number= 32 start=0:02:10 end= 0:02:15
 next 5 years or so, big deep neural networks are going to do amazing things.
<utterance number= 33 start=0:02:15 end= 0:02:20
 I'd like to congratulate all of you who stuck it out long enough to get this far.
<utterance number= 34 start=0:02:20 end= 0:02:25
 I hope you've enjoyed the course and good luck with the final test.
